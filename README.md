Neopixel Painter is a repository for software for controlling a strip of individually addressable RGB NeoPixel LEDs from adafruit.  

It uses the SD card library to load premade bitmap files of correct size (Num Leds px wide x N px tall), and sends each row of the .BMP to the strip right after the other.  It is used in long exposure photography or to get a 'lightstreak', where the light streak is the actual image file.
